          - Analyzing protien sequences to modify their thermostability through amino acid changes, opening up the path for advanced applications.
          - Extracted protein sequence and taxonomic data from NCBI and PDB databases, cleaned the data to rectify inconsistencies and improve data integrity, transformed the raw data using techniques like merging and joining to facilitate further analysis, loaded the optimized datasets for subsequent computational processes.
          - Utilized the ete3 toolkit for phylogenetic tree processing, aligning leaf labels with protein sequence data, tree pruning, and understanding unique sister clades' evolutionary significance. Concurrently, conducted statistical analyses to find correlations between amino acid changes and T growth, visualized with box plots, and designed a linear regression classifier for predicting thermostability based on protien sequences.
